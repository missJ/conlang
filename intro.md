# Introduction

##### Notes

I'm leaning towards **fusional** for simplicity's sake. I like inflections, but I don't want to have to deal with multiples. I'm not going for sci-fi here—it doesn't need to be way out there sounding; it needs to be learnable, useable.

How to inflect, though? I like prefixes, but they're a bitch in a glossary. Perhaps a mix of prefix and suffix...? And reduplication. I love the sound of reduplication.

I think the standard six personal pronouns is nice and simple, but I like the idea of inclusive/exclusive plurals, gender, and theoretical third person.
