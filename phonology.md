### Inspiration

#### Consonants

> You’ll notice that the grid of consonants for English has gaps in it. Does this mean you can invent new sounds by filling in the grid? Oh yes.


> The key to a naturalistic language, in fact, is to add (or subtract) entire dimensions. It’s conceivable that a language could have a single glottalized consonant, but more likely that it will have a series of them (along the points of articulation: p’ t’ k’). A language might have just two palatalized consonants (Spanish does: ll, ñ), but one that has a whole series of them is more typical.

#### Phonemes

> The raw sounds people produce are called **phones**... Each language has a set of **phonemes**—classes of phones that the speakers treat as ‘the same sound’... Because phonemes can be realized with different phones... [English's aspirated and unaspirated 'p' are two realizations (i.e. *phones*) of the unified 'p' sound (the *phoneme*), for example]... Such variations within a language are called **allophones**.

> When you work out the sounds of your conlang, you’re creating a **phonological inventory**—a list of phonemes. That should be the basis of your orthography (or transliteration, if the conlang has its own writing system). Present the phonemes, then you can describe any allophonic variation.

#### Constraints

> Every language has a series of constraints on what possible words can occur in the language. For instance, as an English speaker you know somehow that *blick* and *drass* are possible words, though they don’t happen to exist, but *vlim* and mtar couldn’t possibly be English.

> Designing the **phonological constraints** in your language will go a long, long way to giving it its own distinctive flavor.
